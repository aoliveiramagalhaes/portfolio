### :wave: Hi there!

My name is Aline, and I'm a professional with extensive experience in product and project management, leading cross-functional teams to plan, build, launch and manage top-performing solutions. I'm a **Certified Scrum Product Owner** with in-depth knowledge of Agile ceremonies, prioritization, metrics, marketing orientation, and analytical abilities to evolve product strategy that maximizes organization growth.

I've recently started to take a full-stack web development course at Codecademy and General Assembly, and I am loving it :heart_eyes:  more specifically, front end development. I'm very detail-oriented and problem-solver; skills which I acquired after working in Quality Assurance for so many years.

You can find more details about my experience and skills in my [portfolio](https://aoliveiramagalhaes.github.io/portfolio).

I've created a responsive website in light and dark mode and generated a Lighthouse report to ensure it meets high standard performance, accessibility, and user experience.

Here are the languages and frameworks I used to build my portfolio. I hope you like it :wink:

#### Languages

 #### CSS framework
