### :wave: Hi there!

My name is Aline, and I'm a professional with extensive experience in Product and Project Management.

I've recently started to take a full-stack web development course at Codecademy, and I am loving it :heart_eyes:  more specifically, front end development. I'm very detail-oriented and problem-solver; skills which I acquired after working in Project Management for so many years.

You can find more details about my experience and skills in my [portfolio](https://aoliveiramagalhaes.github.io/portfolio).

I've created a responsive website in light and dark mode and generated a Lighthouse report to ensure it meets high standard performance, accessibility, and user experience.

Here are the languages and frameworks I used to build my portfolio. I hope you like it :wink:

#### Languages
 * HTML
 * JavaScript
 * CSS

 #### CSS framework
 * Bootstrap 4.5

 #### Settings

 Add Sass for DRYing some CSS code.

To compile from scss to css
`yarn build`

To compile continuously --watch:
`yarn watch`
