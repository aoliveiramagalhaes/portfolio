### :wave: Hi there!

My name is Aline, and I'm a professional with +15 years of experience in Project and Product Management with an emphasis on Quality Assurance looking for a career change to Full-Stack Software Engineer :computer:

I've recently started to take software development courses at Codecademy and General Assembly, and I am loving it :heart_eyes: 
more specifically, front end development. I'm very detail-oriented and problem-solver; skills which I acquired after working in Quality Assurance for so many years.

I'm excited about software development, mostly because of its ability to deliver products and value right from my laptop.

You can find more details about my experience and skills in my [portolio](https://aoliveiramagalhaes.github.io/portfolio).

I've created a responsive website in light and dark mode and generated a Lighthouse report to ensure it meets the performance, accessibility, and user experience high standards.

Here are the languages and frameworks I used to build my portfolio. I hope you like it :wink:

#### Languages
 * HTML
 * JavaScript
 * CSS

 #### CSS framework
