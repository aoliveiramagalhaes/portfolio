### :wave: Hi there!

My name is Aline, and I'm a professional with extensive experience in product and project management, leading cross-functional teams to plan, build, launch and manage top-performing solutions. Wide experience with Agile/Scrum methodologies, marketing orientation, and analytical abilities to evolve product strategy that maximizes organization growth.

I've recently started to take a full-stack web development course at Codecademy and General Assembly, and I am loving it :heart_eyes: 
more specifically, front end development. I'm very detail-oriented and problem-solver; skills which I acquired after working in Quality Assurance for so many years.

I'm excited about software development, mostly because of its ability to deliver products and value right from my laptop.

You can find more details about my experience and skills in my [portolio](https://aoliveiramagalhaes.github.io/portfolio).

I've created a responsive website in light and dark mode and generated a Lighthouse report to ensure it meets the performance, accessibility, and user experience high standards.

Here are the languages and frameworks I used to build my portfolio. I hope you like it :wink:
