I'm Aline, and I'm a professional with +15 years of experience in Project and Product Management with an emphasis on Quality Assurance looking for a career change to Front End Development :computer: 

I've recently started to take software development courses and I am loving it :heart_eyes:

Here are the languages and frameworks I used to build my portfolio. I hope you like it! 

#### Languages
 * HTML
 * JavaScript
 * CSS

 #### CSS framework
 * Bootstrap 4.5


 I would be more than happy to give more details on my experience :wink:
